# Online petition - Vlad for a teacher!

An online petition that I created in [Spiced Academy](https://www.spiced-academy.com/) bootcamp as one of the assignments.
The petition was created as a praise to one of my schoolmates for his selfless efforts in helping everyone that couldn't catch up with the curriculum, up to a point where he would gather them after school to explain, and therefore sacrificed his own valuable time, that was scarce during the bootcamp. I wanted the school to know about his efforts so the petition was created based on their own website and the title was Vlad - a new teacher at Spiced!
